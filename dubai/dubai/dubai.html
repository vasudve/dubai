    <p>Dubai, also spelled Dubayy, city and capital of the emirate of Dubai, one of the wealthiest of the seven emirates that
      constitute the federation of the United Arab Emirates, which was created in 1971 following independence from Great Britain.
      There are several theories about the origin of the name Dubai. One associates it with the daba—a type of locust that infests
      the area—while another holds that it refers to a market that existed near the city. In recent years Dubai has been compared
      to Singapore and Hong Kong and is often regarded as the Middle East’s premier entrepôt. Area 13.5 square miles (35 square km).
